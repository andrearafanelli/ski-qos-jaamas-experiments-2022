Experiments for jaamas paper.

### 1. Download datasets
Execute the command ```python -m setup load_datasets [-f] [-o]``` to download datasets from UCI website.
By default, the command will store the original dataset into ```datasets``` folder.
If you specify:
- ```-f y``` to binarize input features;
- ```-o y``` to map the output classes into numeric indices.

Datasets are not tracked by git, so you first need to execute this command before doing anything else.

### 2. Generate knowledge for the census income dataset
Knowledge is already provided for the `poker` dataset and for the `splice junction` dataset.
Instead, for the `census income` dataset it must be generated somehow.
We provide a command `python -m setup generate_census_knowledge` for this purpose.
The knowledge is generated by a classification decision tree trained upon half of the training set.
To make sure that this command is successful, be sure to download the datasets first.
